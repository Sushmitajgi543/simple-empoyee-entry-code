You manage a travel agency, and you want your n drivers to input their following details:

Name of the driver
Driving License Number
Route 
Kms
Your program should be able to take n as input (or you can take n=3 for simplicity),
and your drivers will start inputting their details one by one. Your program should 
print details of the drivers in a beautiful fashion. For this task, you have to use Structure only. 
These four inputs: name, driving license number, route, and km information will be struct members.
After creating struct, you have to create its array of size “n.”
